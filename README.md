# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly). Users are able to create an account and login to see their own list of URL shortcuts (complete with hyperlinks to the sites). These shortened links are generated using a random alpha-numeric string and correspond to your added links.

Feel free to edit, add, and delete URLs in your own URL database!
